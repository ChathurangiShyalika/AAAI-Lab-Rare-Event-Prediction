## **Rare Event Prediction in Manufacturing**

- Rare events are **infrequent occurrences** defined by **specific spatial, temporal, and semantic contexts**.  
- These events **lead to high costs and downtime**, with research showing financial losses of **~$20,000 per minute**.  
- **44% of manufacturers** experience **unplanned downtime** every two months, adding to labor costs.  

### **Examples of Rare Events:**
- **Equipment failures and breakdowns**  
- **Quality defects and anomalies**  
- **Supply chain and inventory issues**

## **Importance of Rare Event Prediction Models**

- Helps identify **infrequent but impactful occurrences** in advance.  
- Improves **operational efficiency** by addressing potential issues proactively.  

### **Technical Challenges:**
- Standard algorithms **struggle** with rare event datasets, leading to **biases** in classification, forecasting, and clustering.  

### **Overall Impact on Operations:**
- **Reduces downtime** and **improves productivity** by implementing effective predictive mechanisms.
