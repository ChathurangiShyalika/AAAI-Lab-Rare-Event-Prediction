# [Part 2] - Exploring the Datasets for Rare Event Analysis

ðŸ“‚ âœ¨  

### **Different Modalities of Datasets:**
- **Numerical** (including sensor data)
- **Textual**
- **Image**
- **Audio**

### **Levels of Rarity**
- Public rare-event datasets available:
  - **Pulp & Paper Manufacturing Dataset** (Rarity: 0.67%)
  - **Air Pressure System (APS) Failure Dataset** (Rarity: 1.67%)
  - **Bosch Production Line Performance Dataset** (Rarity: 0.58%)
  - **Future Factories Dataset** (Rarity: 1.70%)

### **Mainstream Tasks:**
- Rare event detection and prediction
- Anomaly detection and prediction
- Long-term and short-term forecasting

## **Characteristics of Rare Event Datasets and Associated Challenges**

### **Uncertainty:**
- Limited sample size, high class imbalance, and data sparsity reduce confidence and affect generalization in downstream tasks.

### **Skewed Class Distribution and Lack of Data:**
- Class imbalance makes learning patterns for the minority class difficult due to data scarcity.

### **Temporal Property:**
- Capturing time-dependent patterns is challenging due to imbalance and sparsity, requiring specialized techniques.

### **High Dimensionality:**
- Diverse feature sets (numerical, categorical, textual) increase complexity, requiring feature selection or dimensionality reduction.

### **Class Overlap:**
- Overlapping patterns between rare and common events increase misclassification risks, leading to false negatives.

### **Event Complexity:**
- Rare events involve complex relationships between variables, requiring advanced analytical approaches.

## **Factors That Cause Rarity in a Dataset**
- **Natural Occurrences**
- **Sampling Bias**
- **Class Definition**
- **Cost and Measurement Errors**
- **Subjective Decisions**
