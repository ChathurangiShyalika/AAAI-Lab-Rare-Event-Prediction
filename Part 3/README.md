# [Part 3] - Problem 1: Addressing Data Scarcity and Improving the Quality

ðŸ“‚ **: This section includes an introduction hands-on lab focusing on using data augmentation techniques and modeling approaches to improve rare event prediction** âœ¨  

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a process of artificially increasing the amount of data by generating new data points from existing data.
It is an effective way to enhance the size and quality of the training data.
This includes adding minor alterations to data or using machine learning models to generate new data points in the latent space of the original data to amplify the dataset.

## Basic Augmentation Techniques

- **Relative Change:** Measures the percentage change between consecutive data points, providing insights into the magnitude and direction of change over time.
- **Lagged Features:** Incorporates past observations into the dataset by shifting time series data, enabling models to learn historical dependencies.
- **Rolling Window:** Generates overlapping windows of fixed size along the time series and computes summary statistics to capture short-term variations.
- **Expanding Window:** Gradually increases the size of the training data window over time, capturing long-term dependencies.
- **Convolving:** Applies a 1D kernel window to extract local patterns, enhancing feature representation while reducing noise.
- **Pooling:** Reduces the temporal resolution of time series data, minimizing computational cost and the risk of overfitting.
- **Drifting:** Smoothly alters time series values within a predefined range to expose the model to long-term dependencies.
- **Time Warping:** Randomly changes the speed of the timeline to introduce variability and enhance robustness.
- **Quantizing:** Rounds values to a predefined level set, simplifying data for better pattern recognition.
- **Reversing:** Flips the timeline of the series, helping models learn from reversed sequences.
- **Noising:** Introduces random noise to increase variability and improve generalization.

## Advanced Augmentation Techniques

### Seasonal Trend Decomposition Analysis
Decomposes a time series into:
- **Trend:** Captures long-term patterns.
- **Seasonality:** Identifies repetitive fluctuations within fixed time frames.
- **Residual:** Represents random fluctuations and noise.

## Selecting the Best Augmentation Technique

### Consider the Data Characteristics
- **Strong autocorrelation?** Use lagged features.
- **Short-term fluctuations?** Apply rolling window.
- **Long-term dependencies?** Use expanding window.

### Addressing Data Sparsity & Skewness
- **Rare events?** Use drifting.
- **Imbalanced events?** Apply time warping.
- **Extreme values?** Quantizing simplifies distributions.

### Handling Noise and Variability
- **Noisy dataset?** Use convolving to smooth fluctuations.
- **Overfitting concerns?** Introduce noising.
- **Multi-scale patterns?** Apply pooling.

### Ensuring Robustness in Temporal Patterns
- **Seasonal variations?** Use seasonal trend decomposition.
- **Cyclic/reversible patterns?** Try reversing the series.

### Balancing Complexity and Computational Cost
- **Simple datasets?** Start with basic techniques like relative change and lagged features.
- **Complex datasets?** Use advanced methods like seasonal trend decomposition.
- **Limited computational resources?** Avoid costly methods like time warping and drifting.

By selecting the right augmentation technique, we can significantly improve model performance and generalizability.
