        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>In the age of Industry 4.0 and smart automation, unplanned
downtime is costing industries over $50 billion annually.
Even with preventive maintenance, industries like automotive
lose more than $2 million per hour due to downtime caused
by unexpected or “rare” events1. The extreme rarity of these
events makes their detection and prediction a significant challenge
for AI practitioners. Factors such as the lack of highquality
data, methodological gaps in the literature and limited
practical experience with multimodal data exacerbate the
difficulty of rare event detection and prediction. This lab will
provide hands-on experience to learn how to address these
challenges by exploring the entire lifecycle of rare event analysis,
from data generation and preprocessing to model development
and evaluation. The development of a process ontology
and its use for user-level explanations will also be demonstrated.
Participants will be introduced to the limited publicly
available datasets and, more importantly, gain hands-on experience
with a newly developed multi-modal dataset designed
explicitly for rare event prediction. Through several hands-on
sessions, participants will learn how to generate such a highquality
dataset and the practical use of this dataset to develop
rare event prediction models. Those interested in developing
AI models involving diverse multimodal data for other applications
will also benefit from participation.</p>

    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Rare event prediction is pivotal in industrial applications,
particularly in Industry 4.0. These anomalous events, characterized
by their infrequent occurrence, pose significant
challenges for predictive modeling due to the skewed nature
of the data and the complexity of evaluation and lead to
unplanned downtime, reduced equipment lifespan, and increased
energy consumption. Traditional machine learning
methods often struggle in the case of rare events, mainly due
to the scarcity of high-fidelity data and the complex interdependencies
between system components.</p>
        <p>This lab aims to provide participants with practical knowhow
on the entire lifecycle of rare event prediction and the
process of generating explanations for the predicted outcome.
Specifically, we focus on conducting four hands-on
sessions covering (i) the existing dataset and deep dive into
the newly developed FutureFactories dataset, (ii) addressing
data scarcity, imbalance and improving the quality
of data through data augmentation, (iii) exploring the algorithmic
and evaluation methods in rare event prediction, and
(iv) the process of developing a process ontology for the
manufacturing domain and its use in generating user-level
explanations for the predicted outcome. </p>
